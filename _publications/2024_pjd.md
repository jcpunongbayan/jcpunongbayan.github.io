The <em>Philippine Journal of Development</em> (PJD), which marks its 50th year in 2024, has been a key platform for economic policy research in the Philippines. This paper reviews all PJD articles from 2002 to 2023, focusing on trends in topics, authorship, and methodologies. Most articles covered international economics, agriculture, health, and public economics, with contributions mainly from Filipino and multidisciplinary authors. Despite its achievements, the PJD struggles with low visibility and impact, lagging in citations and missing from major journal indexes like Scopus. To address these gaps, the journal could pivot toward more timely and urgent development topics, such as education and climate change, and adopt modern methods like those in the “credibility revolution”. More regular publication and broader engagement with the public (e.g., through social media) can also enhance the PJD’s relevance and impact. These steps will help position the PJD as a premier outlet for policy-relevant research, fostering its growth and influence in the coming decades.
