As the <em>Philippine Journal of Development</em> (PJD) celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2024, this paper reviews all articles published in the journal from 2002 to 2023 and analyzes trends in topics, authorship, and methodologies. Over the past two decades, the PJD has primarily featured studies on international economics, agriculture, health, and public economics, with contributions largely from Filipino and multidisciplinary authors. Despite its longstanding role in socioeconomic policy research, the PJD faces challenges in terms of visibility and impact. This paper recommends covering more timely and urgent development topics, such as education and climate change, alongside the adoption of modern methodologies. It also highlights the importance of increasing publication frequency and engaging more actively with the public to enhance the journal’s relevance and reach.
