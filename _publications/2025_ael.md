<summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper decomposes Philippine inflation into supply and demand components, inspired by recently developed methods. Using Philippine household consumption data, I use a VAR model to distinguish supply-driven from demand-driven inflation from 2001 to 2024. Findings show the predominance of supply-driven components of inflation during key episodes, including the 2008, 2018, and 2022 inflation spikes. The results also suggest that the supply-driven component of inflation responds more to shocks like oil price shocks and even monetary policy shocks from abroad. The study highlights the role of supply-focused policies during times of high inflation, and the role of relatively simple inflation decompositions in monitoring inflation dynamics.
