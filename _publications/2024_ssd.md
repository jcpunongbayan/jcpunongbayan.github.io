<summary>Abstract</summary>
This long-form interview with economist Emmanuel S. de Dios explores the intellectual foundations and evolution of his scholarship in economics and political economy. Through a reflective and candid conversation, de Dios discusses his early influences, engagement with Marxian thought, perspectives on institutional reform and democratic governance, and his approach to mentoring the next generation of Filipino economists. The interview offers insights into the role of critical thinking, interdisciplinarity, and historical awareness in shaping both academic work and public discourse in the Philippines.
