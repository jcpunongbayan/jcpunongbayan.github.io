This book interrogates the persistent myth of a “golden age” during the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines, using data, history, and economic analysis to dismantle the false narratives of prosperity, peace, and progress under martial law. Drawing from academic research, primary sources, and public discourse, False Nostalgia exposes how the Marcos regime’s policies led to economic decline, massive debt, cronyism, and widespread human rights abuses. Written in an accessible style, it equips readers—especially young Filipinos—with the tools to critically evaluate historical revisionism and to guard against authoritarian nostalgia in the digital age.
